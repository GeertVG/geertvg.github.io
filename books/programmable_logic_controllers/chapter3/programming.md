# Programming according IEC 61131
## Programming languages

In a programmable logic controller, it is possible to work with different programming languages, which can be divided into:
- Graphic programming languages
- Textual programming languages

Graphical programming languages are easy to use but limited in their capabilities. Textual programming languages are more complex but more elaborate.

| Programming language        | Acronym       | Type       |
|:---------------------------:|:-------------:|-:---------:|
| Function Block Diagram      | FBD           | Graphic  |
| Ladder Diagram              | LD<sup>1</sup>| Graphic  |
| Sequential Function Chart   | SFC           | Graphic  |
| Instruction List            | IL<sup>2</sup>| Textual  |
| Structured Text             | ST<sup>3</sup>| Textual  |

<sup>2</sup> *Called STL by Siemens (Statement List)* <br>
<sup>3</sup> *Called SCL by Siemens (Structured Control Language)* <br>

It is possible to use different programming languages together in a single PLC project, but only one programming language is permitted within a single block.

The **function block diagram** is a programming language whose graphic symbols are described in the IEC 60617-12 & 13 standard â€“ Graphic symbols for binary logic & analogue elements, in which programming is done with AND, OR, etc. gates, with instructions being collected in networks.
