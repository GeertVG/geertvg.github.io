# Programmable logic controller

A PLC is the "brain" of automated machinery. It is therefore equipped with a programmable controller that uses logical instructions, like AND & OR gates, to create the intelligence.

## Rack

A PLC is primarily mounted in an electrical control cabinet. This involves a modular PLC assembly on a mounting rail.
- If this is a standard DIN C rail, it is called a **mounting rail**.
- Otherwise, it is called a **rack**. Such a rack is designed by the manufacturer and often intended for mounting a specific PLC series.

Some racks are equipped with electronic connectors. These provide the connection between the various modules and the processing unit. If this is not provided, this task is performed by a connector supplied by the manufacturer, or the modules are equipped with connectors that are automatically connected during installation.
