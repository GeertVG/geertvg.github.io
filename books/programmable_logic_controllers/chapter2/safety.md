# Safety according Machine Directive 2006/42/EG

An automated machine or installation often poses hazards for operators as well as for people in the vicinity.

To mitigate these dangerous situations, a machine or technical installation must comply with various laws. One of these laws is called the Machinery Directive and is mandatory (i.e., mandatory compliance) in all member states of the European Union.

To identify all hazards, a risk analysis is conducted. This analysis is then expanded to include:
- Possible solutions to eliminate risks
- Necessary protective measures for risks that cannot be eliminated
- Information in the form of pictograms, manuals, and possibly training courses that inform operators about residual risks and indicate whether personal protective equipment is required.

## Summary of safety in the Machinery Directive:

Control systems must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from arising. Above all, they must be designed and constructed in such a way that:
- They can withstand the intended operating stresses and external influences,
- A fault in the hardware or the software of the control system does not lead to hazardous situations,
- Errors in the control system logic do not lead to hazardous situations,
- reasonably foreseeable human error during operation does not lead to hazardous situations.

Particular attention must be given to the following points
- The machinery must not start unexpectedly, even after a power failure. Startup may only occur through a deliberate action using a control device designed for this purpose (=start push button),
- The machinery must be equipped with a control device that allows it to be stopped completely in a safe manner (=stop push button),
- The machinery must not be prevented from stopping if the stop command has already been given (=if you press the start and stop buttons simultaneously, the machine should stop),
- The machinery must not be prevented from stopping if the stop command has already been given (= pressing the stop button must stop the machine in a controlled manner, even if the stop button is defective = normally closed contact),
- The parameters of the machinery must not change in an uncontrolled way, where such change may lead to hazardous situations (=use of retentive data),
- No moving part of the machinery or piece held by the machinery must fall or be ejected in case of a fault in the power supply (=a fault in a pneumatic circuit may not lead to the fall of pieces),
- Machinery must be fitted with one or more emergency stop devices to enable actual or impending danger to be averted (=emergency stop push button),
- The emergency stop device must be clearly recognizable (=red push button on a yellow background),
- The emergency stop function must be available and operational at all times, regardless of the operating mode.
- The safety-related parts of the control system must apply in a coherent way to the whole of an assembly of machinery and/or partly completed machinery (=if it is not active, the machine must not be started),
- The emergency stop device must stop a hazardous process as quickly as possible without creating additional (new) risks (=a moving overhead crane must stop as quickly as possible in an emergency stop without the load to "swing"),
- Emergency stop devices must be a back-up to other safeguarding measures and not a substitute for them (=an emergency stop is not a stop button).

If machinery is equipped with a red-yellow main switch, it is permitted to perform an emergency stop function by switching the main switch to the OFF-0 position.
If a machine or technical installation is equipped with a main switch other than the red-yellow switch (e.g., black), it is not permitted to perform an emergency stop function using this main switch.
