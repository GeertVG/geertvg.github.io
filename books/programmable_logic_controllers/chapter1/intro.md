# Introduction

**Automation** or **mechatronics** involves the automatic execution of tasks and/or commands by electrical devices, machines, or technical installations.

To achieve this, these devices, machines, and installations require the following:
- **Senses** to perceive the current state
- Adjustable **power** to achieve a desired state
- A **brain** to process the senses and control the power

The artificial senses are called **sensors** and consist primarily of mechanical and electronic components that register physical quantities or a state and convert them into an electrical signal.

The **adjustable power** units, called actuators, consist, like the sensors, primarily of mechanical and electronic components. These components are often expanded with hydraulic, pneumatic, or electrical components to switch and/or control higher power levels.

As a **programmable brain**, one or more processors are used in combination with one or more memories to process the signals from the sensors and thus control the actuators. The entire unit is called the processing unit.

Automation and mechatronics are therefore fields that consist of several disciplines in which mechanical and electronic components are prominently present.
