# Process types
---
The **type of process** can also be categorized. A distinction is made between:
- Continuous processes
- Sequential processes
- Batch processes

A **continuous process** is one that is (almost) never stopped. In other words, production is continuous and never stops. Stopping production can result in defects or the forced shutdown of the production process, resulting in production losses. For example, a glass furnace for the production of thin glass (used in windows, solar panels, etc.) is never stopped during its life-cycle.

As an exception, some continuous processes are stopped once a year for about two weeks for maintenance purposes or in the event of a hazard (e.g., a nuclear power plant). This is called a "shutdown".

A **sequential process** is a process that runs in steps, where actions are frequently started and stopped. The automated process can be divided into different steps. For example, an automated pallet stacker crane will involve the following steps:
- Grabbing the pallet (and placing it on the crane)
- Driving the pallet to the desired rack in the warehouse
- Putting the pallet away in the rack
- Driving to the next pallet

A **batch process** (also called a serial process) is neither a continuous nor a sequential process, but it nevertheless contains characteristics of both. A characteristic is that the production quantity is predetermined and production is serial. Production is continuous throughout the entire batch, but various actions occur in steps.
